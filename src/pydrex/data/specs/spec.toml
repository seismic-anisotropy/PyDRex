# PyDRex TOML configuration specification.
# Exactly one valid combination of fields from the [input] section are required,
# the rest is optional.

# Simulation name is optional but recommended.
name = "pydrex-spec"

# Input files/options are given in this section:
[input]

# Input data can be provided in one of three ways:
# 1. An input mesh with the steady-state numerical velocity gradient field
#    and a plain text SCSV file specifying the FINAL locations of the polycrystals.
#    In this case, polycrystals will first be back-propagated along flow pathlines,
#    and then forward-propagated while the CPO is calculated.
#    The SCSV file should have column names 'X', 'Y', 'Z' for 3D or any two of those for 2D.
# 2. A built-in (analytical) velocity gradient function from `pydrex.velocity_gradients`,
#    its arguments, and INITIAL locations of the polycrystals. In this case,
#    polycrystals will immediately be forward-advected in the specified field.
# 3. Pre-computed pathline files with velocity gradients at each point.
#    These can be either plain text SCSV files or binary NPZ files.
#    They should have columns/fields called: 'X_id', 'Y_id', 'Z_id', 'L11_id', 'L12_id', 'L13_id', etc.
#    where 'id' is replaced by an unique identifier of the particle/pathline.
#    If a field called 't' is also present, it will be used for the timestamps.
#    Alternatively, a fixed timestep for all paths can be specified using `timestep`.
# 4. Names of fields to be read from a geodynamics framework during runtime (not implemented yet).

# Example for method 1, not only .vtu but any format supported by meshio should work:
# mesh = "filename.vtu"
# locations_final = "filename.scsv"
# timestep = 1e9

# Example for method 2:
velocity_gradient = ["simple_shear_2d", "Y", "X", 5e-6]
locations_initial = "start.scsv"
timestep = 1e9

# Example for method 3:
# timestep = 1e9
# paths = ["path001.npz", "path002.scsv"]

# In cases where the pathlines do not exit the domain,
# a maximum strain threshold can bee provided, after which advection is halted.
# strain_final = 10

# Output files/options are given in this section:
[output]

# Optional output directory, will be created if missing.
# This is also relative to the parent directory of the TOML file,
# unless an absolute path is given.
directory = "out"

# Optional choice of mineral phases to include in raw output.
# Raw output means rotation matrices and grain volumes, so 10 floats per grain per mineral.
# By default, raw output for all supported minerals is saved.
raw_output = ["olivine"]

# Optional choice of mineral phases to include in diagnostic output.
# Diagnostic output includes texture symmetry, strength and mean angle results.
# By default, diagnostic output for all supported minerals is saved.
diagnostics = ["olivine"]

# Should anisotropy postprocessing results be calculated?
# This uses voigt averaging so the effective values for the multiphase polycrystal are calculated.
anisotropy = true

# Optional pathline output files (velocity gradients, positions, timestamps, particle ids).
# Pathline output files use the same format as pathline inputs (by default, they are not produced).
# They are stored inside the output directory unless absolute paths are given.
# paths = ["pathline001.scsv"]

# Optional logging level for log files.
# This sets the log level for all log files, overriding the default value of "WARNING".
# Supported levels are controlled by Python's logging module.
# Usually they are "CRITICAL", "ERROR", "WARNING", "INFO" and "DEBUG".
log_level = "DEBUG"

# DREX and simulation parameters are given in this section:
[parameters]

# Optional mineral phase content to use for the aggregate.
# phase_content = ["olivine", "enstatite"]

# Optional volume fractions of the mineral phases present in the aggregate.
# phase_fractions = [0.7, 0.3]

# Optional initial olivine fabric. A-type by default.
initial_olivine_fabric = "A"

# Optional DREX stress_exponent, see documentation for details.
stress_exponent = 1.5

# Optional DREX deformation_exponent, see documentation for details.
deformation_exponent = 3.5

# Optional DREX grain boudary mobility, see documentation for details.
gbm_mobility = 125

# Optional DREX grain boundary sliding threshold, see documentation for details.
gbs_threshold = 0.3

# Optional DREX nucleation efficiency, see documentation for details.
nucleation_efficiency = 5.0

# Optional number of (initial) grains per mineral phase per polycrystal.
number_of_grains = 2000
