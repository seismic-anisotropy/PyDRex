#### Simulate crystallographic preferred orientation evolution in polycrystals

This repository contains a Python 3 reimplementation of the D-Rex model
for the evolution of crystallographic preferred orientation in polycrystals.
The code is available for use under the [GNU GPL v3](LICENSE) license.
Documentation is accessible via Python's REPL `help()` and also [online](https://patol75.github.io/PyDRex/).

## Install

Check `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` for the minimum required Python
version.

The package is currently not available on PyPi, so installation requires `git`.
Install the package with Python's `pip`:

    pip install git+https://github.com/adigitoleo/PyDRex#egg=pydrex

Alternatively, clone the [source code](https://github.com/Patol75/PyDRex).
and execute `pip install $PWD` in the top-level folder.
To install additional dependencies required only for the test suite,
use `pip install $PWD[test]`.

For a complete development install, including documentation generator dependencies,
use `pip install -e $PWD[dev]`.

The package metadata and full list of dependencies are specified in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

## Test

Some tests can optionally output figures or extended diagnostics when run locally.
Check the [test suite README](tests/README.md) for details.

## Documentation

The documentation can be built offline using [pdoc](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc),
with the command:

    pdoc -t docs/template -o html --math pydrex tests

which will output the html documentation into a folder called `html`.
The homepage will be `html/index.html`.
